                    I don't believe that the overall page length itself is inherently problematic.
                    I have noticed though that in many responsive designs, purposeful groupings of
                    content are easy to spot on larger screens, but get muddled when things start to
                    stack on mobile screens.
                    <br />
                    <img src= "blockquote2.jpg" />
                    </p>
                </div>

            <p>
                This is probably mostly a problem on "content" sites in which you smash
                things down into the ol' tube of content. I don't mind the tube,
                but I think Kevin is doing some smart thinking here. There are plenty of
                different patterns that can happen while tubizing, and it's probably
                not thought about enough.
            </p>

                This site is particularly guilty. A quick
                document.documentElement.offsetHeight test showed 14749px,
                more than double the height of an example Kevin pointed out that was a
                bit excessive.
